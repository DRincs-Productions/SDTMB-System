**IMPORTANT**: is still in development

In order to simplify the update work and avoid errors in saving I created functions that check the correct state of variables by inserting them in [after_load](game/tool/core.rpy#L1) (e.g. after a change to a quest that causes a stage to be blocked, the quest should restart) and an abundant use of define.

## Insert Toolkit in your project

I recommend the following ways to include it in your project:

- [**Pull branch**](#pull-branch) (to **insert** it into your game and **update** it easily)
- [**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (to improve the repo or create a Toolkit based on mine)
- [Manually](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/STMB-Device/releases) (not recommended)

### Pull branch

To **insert** or **update** the Toolkit in your repo with Pull branch I recommend the following procedure:

(only if you want to insert the repo) Create a new empty branch, in the example I'll use **stmb-device**

```shell
git checkout -b stmb-device
git checkout stmb-device
git config pull.rebase false
git pull https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/STMB-Device.git tool-only --allow-unrelated-histories

```

At the end make a merge inside the arm of the project.
